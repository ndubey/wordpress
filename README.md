<h3>Posting code in your blog</h3>
Depending upon your need you can use tag code
e.g.

<code> ls </code> 

A proper detailed version:
[ code language="language of your choice"]  Code in language of your choice [/code]
language can be many like cpp, bash, css, html

will give you (for language = "csharp")

[code language="csharp"] Console.Writeln("Learning Wordpress");[/code]

You can insert formula using $latex \LaTeX$

Like let us say you want to write formula 4/2 = 2 with latex

$latex \frac{4}{2} = 2 $

Like

$latex A = \int \frac{1}{t^2}.dt = -\frac{1}{t} $

$latex \int_0^1 f(x) \, \mathrm{d} x $ 

$latex i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left|\Psi(t)\right>=H\left|\Psi(t)\right>$
